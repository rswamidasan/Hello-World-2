Hello-World-2
=============

My 2nd try at creating a repository.

Okay!  At last!  It appears that the instructions on the GitHub Bootcamp pages don't quite match what I see on my PC (Win 8.1).  I did 
not see an option for "Initalize this Repository with a README".  After playing around I got to this page and am entering some
lines.  Not absolutely sure that THIS is the README file, as there's another Create README.md edit space (whatchamacallit)
below.  But let's see and let's hope I can repeat this process in the simplest manner.
