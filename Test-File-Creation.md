I wanted to test the file creation process -- before submitting my Data Science course project work -- because, honestly, the
process is not very clear or intuitive.  I know, it WILL turn out to be easy once I've done it a few times; but it's not 100%
unambiguous from the start.  For instance, the project assignment instructions say:
(1) Create a text file ...
(2) Add the line ...
(3) Push the file ... to your repo ...
(4) Submit the link ...

But following the instructions on GitHub / Git Reference, I went straight to my repo and added a file.  I am already Online, on
GitHub, in my account.  Do I now need to "PUSH" the file as well.  A PUSH, as I understand it, is used to send the changes you 
made (committed) on a local repository to the remote repository.  If I am already Online at GitHub.com, the changes I'm making
(in this case, creating a new file) are already in the "remote" repository. I don't need a "Push".  No?

In any case, will someone else (say a course evaluator), be able to distinguish between (i) a file that has been created locally
and pushed, and (ii) a file that was created online directly in the remote repository?  How so?

WIll they deduct marks for this?

Is there any difference between the 2 methods when I own the repo and do not need a local copy of the file?

Then, there's this stuff about the master branch, and creating a new branch followed by a "pull" requsest.

Hmm!  Not very clear.  I guess I'll need to explore on my own.
